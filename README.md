# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
Steve is a financial advisor, and his parents want his help to invest in green energy they are particularly interested in DAQO New Energy (DQ). Steve came to me to assist him in analyzing green energy stocks including DQ. I used VBA to help him perform this analysis and we determined that DQ is not the best option for Steveâ€™s parents. He would now like me to create a code so that he can analyze the entire stock market over the past few years in a timely manner. This will allow him to better advise his parents on which stocks to invest their money in.  

### Purpose
Create a code so that Steve can analyze the entire stock market in a timely manner.
