# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
Steve is a financial advisor, and his parents want his help to invest in green energy they are particularly interested in DAQO New Energy (DQ). Steve came to me to assist him in analyzing 12 green energy stocks including DQ. I used VBA to help him perform this analysis and we determined that DQ is not the best option for Steveâ€™s parents. He would now like me to modify this code so that if he wanted to analyze the entire stock market over the past few years he could do so in a timely manner. 

### Purpose
Create a code that can be executed in a timely manner so that Steve can analyze the entire stock market. 

## Results
Comparing the 12 green energy stocks that Steve wants to look at, it is evident that in 2017 all stocks performed well except for TERP however in 2018 the only stocks that performed well were ENPH and RUN. Based on these results the stock that Steve's parents are interested in, DQ, performed well in 2017 as the price increased 199.4%. However, in 2018 DQ did not perfrom well as the stock price dropped 62.6%. 

The original code that I created for Steve to analyze the 12 energy stocks took 0.773 seconds and 0.843 seconds to execute for the years 2017 and 2018, respectively.

The original code included nested loops which... time required to execute the code. 

    'Assign Arrays and Indexes
    Dim tickers(12) As String

    tickers(0) = "AY"
    tickers(1) = "CSIQ"
    tickers(2) = "DQ"
    tickers(3) = "ENPH"
    tickers(4) = "FSLR"
    tickers(5) = "HASI"
    tickers(6) = "JKS"
    tickers(7) = "RUN"
    tickers(8) = "SEDG"
    tickers(9) = "SPWR"
    tickers(10) = "TERP"
    tickers(11) = "VSLR"
    
    'Initalize variables
    Dim startingPrice As Double
    Dim endingPrice As Double
    
    Worksheets(YearValue).Activate

    'Find the number of rows to loop over
    RowCount = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    'Loop through tickers
    For i = 0 To 11
    
        ticker = tickers(i)
        totalVolume = 0
        
        'Loop through rows
        Worksheets(YearValue).Activate
        For j = 2 To RowCount
        
            'Total volume
            If Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
            
                totalVolume = totalVolume + Cells(j, 8).Value
                
                End If
                
            'Starting price
            If Cells(j - 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
            
                startingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
                
                End If
            
            'Ending price
            If Cells(j + 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
            
                endingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
                
                End If
                
        Next j

The refractored code did not include nested loops and so it was fasted. It was executed in 0.140 seconds and 0.137 seconds for 2017 and 2018, respectively.
